# psmHeatmapRScripts
This script allows for the creation of PSM ratio heatmap .pdf documents. The version hosted here has been created for use with data from MS SMiV. It subdivides input data and creates heatmaps for each protein and sample. These heatmaps can then be used to infer variant peptides and PTMs. 

See example.pdf for a possible heatmap.
